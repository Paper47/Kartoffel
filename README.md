A quick game skeleton with low effort sprites and logic.

This is a quick low-effort game idea created in Godot 4.5

I created a VERY simple game idea which involved seeking out a button to open a laser door to get to a win condition, with the risk of falling into a void.

Step 1: find the button

Step 2: make it to the flag.

  arrow keys for moving left and right
  space bar to jump
